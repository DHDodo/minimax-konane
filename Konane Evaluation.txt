Konane Evaluation
Authors: Briar Sauble and Robert Bunning

The heuristic we used for the evaluation function of our MinimaxPlayer, dubbed
"Super Minimax Deluxe", is a jumpable neighbors count. Given a board, each part
on the board that has a piece is analyzed in order to see if it can made a 
jump. This check simplifies the rules of the game to not take into 
consideration a piece being two pieces away to block a jump, as the value 
being considered is if the piece could potentially have jumps in the future.
It also does not take into consideration cases where a multiple jump could 
occur in order to prevent possible heuristic skews. If the current piece 
being looked at is one of our own, the heuristic adds 1 for each jump the
piece could do given our simplified ruleset--and on the contrary, the
opponent's jumps will subtract from the heuristic. 

The idea of the heuristic is to maximize the amount of possible jumps that 
our pieces could have. Ideally, if the pieces on our side of the board
are correctly moved so that they are less likely to lead to "dead pieces", or
pieces on the board that can't be used for jumps, then we will be more likely 
to win the match. A positive score given for a board in this instance with this 
assumption is that we are winning, since the amount of jumps that we're holding 
on this board is beating out the opponents. If it's negative, we're losing, and 
we want to try getting back to a positive value to win over an opponent. This 
assumption on the best features to focus on comes from the basic rules of the 
game--to lose, you must run out of valid moves, so it would be for the best 
to have pieces be in spaces where they won't run out of moves. This is not 
always true, but this assumption allows for a simplistic evaluation without the
use of deeper learning to, in the best case, win against an opponent.
